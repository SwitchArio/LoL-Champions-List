# LoL-Champions-List
A list of all the champions of League of Legends

With specified the main lane (most played) and the secondary lane in case the champion can also play in another lane
In case the champion is also played in a lane other than the main one, next to the lane name I have written a '?' followed by a number
That number rapresents the percentage of times out of the total the champion is played

The list is something like this:
...
Akali;mid;top?30;
Urgot;top;none;
...
